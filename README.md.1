# When to use * and & in go?

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a := 10
	fmt.Printf("The value of a: %v\n", a)
	fmt.Printf("The type of a: %T\n\n", a)

	b := &a
	fmt.Printf("The value of b: %v\n", b)
	fmt.Printf("The type of b: %T\n\n", b)

	var c *int
	c = b
	fmt.Printf("The value of c: %v\n", c)
	fmt.Printf("The type of c: %T\n\n", c)

	*c++
	fmt.Println(a)
}
a := 10

I declare a variable named "a" and assign it the value "10". Because i didn't declare a type the compiler assigns it a type based on the value i assigned. The type is "int"

b := &a

I declare a variable named "b" and assign it the value of "the memory address of a". Because i didn't declare the type of "b" the compiler assigns it a type based on the value i assigned, in this case it is of type "pointer to an int". The value it holds is the memory address of "a"

var c *int:

I declare a variable that is named "c" and of type "pointer to an int". Because i didn't assign a value it will be set to its "Zero value (Go Playground)" by the compiler. The value it holds is nill.

c = b

I assign the value of "b" to a variable called "c". The value it holds is the memory address stored in "b".

*c++

Look at the memory address stored in "c", retrieve the value stored under that address and increment it by one. Write the result value back into the location the memory address points to.

Hope this helps in some way =)
